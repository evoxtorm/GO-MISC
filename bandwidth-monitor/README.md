* Retrieve Network Interface Information: Use a network library or system calls to gather information about available network interfaces on the computer, such as interface names, IP addresses, and other relevant details.

* Start Monitoring: Select the network interface you want to monitor and begin capturing network traffic on that interface. You can use packet capturing libraries like libpcap or libraries specific to your programming language.

* Calculate Network Usage: Continuously monitor incoming and outgoing packets on the selected interface. Calculate the size of each packet and accumulate the total data transferred over time. Update the statistics for upload and download speeds accordingly.

* Display Real-Time Statistics: Create a user interface (CLI) to display real-time statistics such as upload/download speeds, total data transferred, and any other relevant information you want to track. Update the UI at regular intervals to reflect the latest network usage data.
